# Autonomous Snowplow Software Team

## Introduction

The autonomous snowplow team focuses on designing a robotic snowplow for competition. Quick facts about the team:

- Our robot's name is Hy-flex
- We compete every January at [Dunwoody College of Technology in Minneapolis](https://mail.autosnowplow.com/welcome.html)
- The snowplow project was founded in 2015

The team is divided into groups of different technical expertise:

- Electrical
- Mechanical
- Software

## Role of the Software Team

The software team instructs the robot on how to move. The robot does not take human input during competition so this is hard to do well. Instead, the robot takes in its surroundings with sensors and decides its next movements. This involves using path planning algorithms and other strategies to clear a snow surface within the competition's rules.

As a part of the software team you will be essentially creating the **brains** of the **robot**.

## Technologies Used

The software team uses Python for all programming. It is completely alright if you are unfamiliar with Python, there are tutorials online and you'll learn along the way. Python is a fairly simple language that I believe can be mastered by everyone.

Here is a tutorial I recommend: [Python Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python)

With Python, we use a framework called ROS 2. ROS 2 stands for Robot Operating System 2. It is a development kit for creating robotic applications. ROS 2 will seem extremely foreign the first time you'll code with it but as the year goes on I believe everyone can master it the same as Python.

Here is an intro overview of ROS 2 I recommend: [ROS 2 Introduction](https://youtu.be/7TVWlADXwRw?si=22iAkbewI1WpEhDJ)

The specific version of ROS 2 we use is called ROS 2 Iron Irwini.

## Getting Started - First Meeting

1. First make sure you are on the Bison Robotic's Discord server and are on the snowplow channel
2. Create a GitHub account
3. Install VirtualBox or VMWare and Ubuntu 22.04
   - [Tutorial for VirtualBox and Ubuntu 22.04 Install](https://medium.com/@maheshdeshmukh22/how-to-install-ubuntu-22-04-lts-on-virtualbox-in-windows-11-6c259ce8ef60)

We'll instruct you through the rest at later meetings.
